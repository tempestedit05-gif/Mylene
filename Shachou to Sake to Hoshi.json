  "description": "After the sudden death of her father, 24-year-old Reina Izutsu finds herself at the helm of the family business, Izutsu Printing. Thrust into the role of company president, the pressure quickly hardens her demeanor—leaving her employees walking on eggshells, especially Kenichi Ishizumi, the stoic 37-year-old section chief. One night, overwhelmed and tipsy in a quiet park, Reina blurts out, “That's it! I quit being everyone's boss!”—completely unaware that the man beside her is her employee. Under the soft glow of the stars, he listens silently… and makes a quiet vow to stand by her side.",
